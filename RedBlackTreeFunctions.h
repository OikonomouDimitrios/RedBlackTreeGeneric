 * - `error` is a pointer to a variable that can be used to indicate any errors that occur during the insertion process.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 * - If the value was successfully inserted into the tree, the function sets *error to 0.
 * - If the value already exists in the Red-Black Tree, the function sets *error to a non-zero value that indicates that
 *   an error occurred during insertion, and returns without modifying the RedBlackTree struct.

 *                 const void pointers as arguments and returns an integer.
 *                 The function should return a negative integer if the first
 *                 argument is less than the second, a positive integer if the
 *                 first argument is greater than the second, and 0 if they
 *                 are equal.
 * - transform_key_to_string_func: a valid function pointer to a function that takes
 *                                  a const void pointer as the first argument, a
 *                                  char buffer as the second argument, and the size
 *                                  of the buffer as the third argument. The function
 *                                  should not modify the key and should transform it
 *                                  into a human-readable string representation that
 *                                  fits within the provided buffer in order for it to be
 *                                  user by rbt_print_tree function.
 * - buffer_size: the maximum size of the buffer passed to transform_key_to_string_func
 *                which must not exceed 100.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 * - Returns a pointer to the newly initialized Red-Black Tree.
